          <h3>12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Informal Negotiations</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
            controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute"
            and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us
            (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the
            Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
            those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 10
            days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations
            commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Restrictions</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
            Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
            permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
            arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
            procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
            to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
            the general public or any other persons.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
            above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding
            arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
            concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights
            of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations
            of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c)
            any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
            illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
            any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
            be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
            court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
            jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
            jurisdiction of that court.

            These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us
            on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire
            agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms
            shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
            Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may
            assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
            time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
            delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
            control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal
            Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these
            Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of
            any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
            employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
            result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that
            these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of
            having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
            have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack
            of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
